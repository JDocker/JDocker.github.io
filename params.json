{"name":"Djpaas.GitHub.io","tagline":"DJ PaaS - Modular and Simple PaaS orchestration using Docker and more...","body":"### Welcome to DJPaas\r\nThis is the DJPaaS project page. DJ hereby is not related to electronic music but simply an acronym for Docker and Java, the 2 main technologies we plan to use for our PaaS. Many of you will ask, why we stick to Java, because most of other implementations are running on Go or Node.js. The first answer is trivial, becasue we know Java and its ecosystem well and we really love Java. But there might be more. Java allows us to integrate easily with existing code bases much more easily, because our PaaS also can be run embedded. Similarly we hope that other Java enthusiasts will take time and join us, bringing this to live so it is a real benefit for the whole Java community.\r\n\r\n### Project State\r\nBasically the project is in its early stages. Honestly speaking we just starting collecting ideas.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFounder of the initiative is @atsticks also known by many as star spec lead for JSR 354 and Apache Tamaya founder and committer. \r\n\r\n### Want to Contribute?\r\nIf you want to contribute code, know how or whatever just drop us a mail. Beforehand you should fill and sign the Contributor License Agreement (here - sorry still tbd).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
